# INST414-capstone-project


This repository contains the code and analysis for Sprint 3 of the Home Mortgage Data project. The goal of this sprint was to build predictive models to classify loan applications as approved or denied using the 2024 HMDA Modified Loan/Application Register (LAR) dataset. Models explored include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Key tasks completed in this sprint:
Data preprocessing and feature encoding

Baseline model evaluation using a Dummy Classifier

Training and evaluation of primary models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Cross-validation to assess generalization

Feature importance analysis and visualizations

Error analysis and discussion of limitations
